# Updater
This program is a naiive upadater application. It consumes .ndiff files found next to it, and applies them automatically if it can.
Its goal is to be a quick means of updating a directory for a user. It attempts to provide reasonable security against corruption by comparing hashes before/after patching, and aborts before any actual changes are made to disk.

.ndiff files are generated by nSuite using the `-diff` command. 

This program essentially encapsulates nSuite's `-patch` command.

It doesn't use any fancy rendering library, it instead runs in a terminal and requires minimal user input.

This application has 1 (one) resource embedded within it:
  - IDI_ICON1		the application icon
