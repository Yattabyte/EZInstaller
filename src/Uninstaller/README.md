# Uninstaller
This program is a fully-fledged uninstallation application, made to run on Windows. It is generated by the installer application, and removes itself from the user's registry on completion.

It uses the Windows GDI library for rendering.

This application has 2 (two) resources embedded within it:
  - IDI_ICON1		the application icon
  - IDR_MANIFEST	the installer manifest (attributes, strings, instructions)
    
The raw version of this application is useless on its own, and is intended to be fullfilled by the Installer application.
The following is how the Installer uses this application:
  - writes out a copy of this application to disk
  - embedds its own manifest into **this application's** IDR_MANIFEST resource (to facilitate uninstallation)
 
This uninstaller has several screens it displays to the user.
If at any point an error occurs, the program enters a failure state and dumps its entire operation log to disk (next to the program, error_log.txt).

The uninstaller may reuse several of the manifest strings provided by its proceeding installer, such as name, version, and where shortcuts may be located (to remove them).
